# Hospital-Management-System

***Introduction***<br>
This project is a software application that provides doctors and patients with various functionalities.
And also details pertaining to the room that are present in the hospital. In this project we have
implemented file management operations along with the concept of B-tree implementation in Java
so that the application is robust and managing the system becomes easier too.<br>
Typical Features include:<br>
● Adding new Records – New Records can be added to the patients field, and the doctors field.
And their respective details regarding their accommodation can also be added.<br>
● Searching individual Records – A user can search a specific record by keying in the ID for the
required doctor or patient they are looking for. It displays all the details regarding that record.<br>
● Listing all Records under a category – If a user likes to list out all the records under the doctor
category then they can do so by specifying the category.<br>
● Deleting Records – The details and the respective records for doctors or patients can be deleted
from the system is a systematic manner.<br>
● Availability reports – The availability reports of the rooms that have been occupied and the
remaining once details can also be retrieved in a report format.<br>

***Motivation and Scope***<br>
Our present modern information system makes use of computers for the execution, each of them
connected through an optimized network. Healthcare is the most critical aspect of our society, and
many health care providers face challenges to offer practical and active services to patients.
Considering a multi-specialty hospital, many people enter and exit the hospital in a day and
maintaining their records safely is tedious. To reduce this type of burdens and to manage the
financial, hospital administration and clinical aspects, Hospital management system came into
existence. Apart from that, automating hospital's processes and implementing them cannot be done
too easily. Also need an efficient hospital management system to take care of everything that is
happening around the labs and hospitals.<br>

***Problem Statement***<br>
Design and develop a management System for a Hospital to perform all required details processing
operations using Files to store, retrieve and render from. Such operations can include Creation of
Files where the records can be inserted, Deletion of records from the Files, Modification of file
Content, finding the required contents from the File.

***Limitations***<br>
Swing was very innovative and flexible at its time and this is the time of the dotcom bubble when
Java folks were expecting to execute java desktop applications everywhere the internet reaches. At
that time the internet was very slow compared to now so rich client applications were designed
more like a desktop application where you need a Java Runtime. All modern browsers support
Javascript and Java plugins are not trusted by browser developers so Javascript took over the lead
when it comes to RIA over the internet. That is the main drawback of Swing and to a degree Javafx
now. People prefer HTML + JS over Java.
So besides this, what are the technical limitations of Swing?<br>
1) The component palette is limited. We need to use 3rd party libraries for a datepicker or
treetable for example.<br>
2) It uses MVC inside but does not allow you to use MVC with Swing components because it
is hard to separate model parts of Swing components. We need to write your own model
implementations for that purpose.<br>
3) You need to pay attention to how Event Dispatcher Thread works otherwise a trivial thing
like a busy indicator becomes a nightmare.
